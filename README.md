# Prune your follows

After almost 15 years on Twitter I hit the 5000 follows limit, and found it hard to figure out what accounts to unfollow...

Enter Prune your follows, it lets you filter accounts by:

- Inactive
- Overactive
- Unpopular
- Overpopular

and fuzzy search:

- username
- name
- description
- location

Still a work in progress, will soon be launched at pruneyourfollows.com.
